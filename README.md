# Monitoring System

Implementation of a monitoring system project.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at creating a simple and efficient monitoring system for tracking key indicators of a system using a kernel and dynamic agents. The system should collect metrics from agents, log them, and send notifications to users in case of critical values.

## Project Structure

- `src`: Contains the C++ code for the monitoring system.
- `agents`: Dynamic libraries (*.so) for different agent types.
- `logs`: Stores log files generated by the monitoring system.

## System Architecture

The monitoring system consists of a kernel and dynamic agents. Agents are lightweight programs collecting metrics and passing them to the kernel, which logs the data. The system notifies users when critical values are reached.

### Agent Implementation

Agents are implemented as dynamic libraries (*.so) and can be loaded or unloaded while the system is running. Each agent has an `updateMetrics()` method to provide actual metrics to the kernel.

### Kernel

The kernel periodically calls agent methods, records metrics in a log file, and scans the `./agents/` folder for new agents.

## Coding Standards

- Implemented in C++17.
- Code located in the `src` folder.
- Follow Google style for code formatting.

## Build System

- Use a Makefile with standard GNU targets: `all`, `install`, `uninstall`, `clean`, `dist`, `tests`.

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Install the project
make install

# Uninstall the project
make uninstall

# Clean the project
make clean
```

## GUI Implementation

- Implement GUI using Qt GUI library with API for C++17.

## MVC Pattern

- Implement the system using the MVC pattern.
- No business code in the view.
- No interface code in the controller and the model.
- Thin controllers.

## Agents and Metrics

- Provide at least three types of agents: CPU, Memory, Network.
- Each agent collects specific metrics.

## Agent Configuration

- Agents are configured via a configuration file.
- Configuration includes agent name, type, critical metrics values, and update time.

## Notifications

- Use a Telegram bot to send notifications about critical situations.
- Include computer name, metric name, and value in the notification.
- Enable/disable email notifications in the interface.

## Additional Agent

- Implement an agent with special metrics.

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Build a specific agent
make cpu_agent
make memory_agent
make network_agent
make system_agent

# Build and run cppcheck
make cppcheck

# Run clang-format
make clang-format

# Create a distribution package
make dist
```

## Documentation

- Generate documentation using Pandoc.

```bash
make dvi
```
